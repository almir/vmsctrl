IMPORTANT

The USERNAME and the VMSPATH variables contained inside /etc/default/vmsctrl.conf file
should be set to reflect your system.

The path where virtual machines are stored, or the name of the virtual machine itself,
must not contain spaces in order for script to work properly.
Also, the path to the vmrun must be configured within the environment variables.
